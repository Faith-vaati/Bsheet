<!-- HTML tables use the caption element to describe what the table is about. The caption element should always be the first child of a table, but can be positioned with the caption-side CSS property.
 


 The thead and tbody elements are used to indicate which portion of your table is the header, and which portion contains the primary data or content.


The tr element is used to indicate a table row. Add a tr element within your thead element. In your new tr element, add a td element, followed by three th elements.


The CSS you are about to write is a common set of properties used to ensure elements are completely hidden visually.

The span[class~="sr-only"] selector will select any span element whose class includes sr-only. Create that selector, and give it a border property set to 0.




The CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of an element. Set the span[class~="sr-only"] selector to have a clip property of rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px).



The clip-path property determines the shape the clip property should take. Set both the clip-path and -webkit-clip-path properties to the value of inset(50%), forming the clip-path into a rectangle within the element



To prevent the text content from overflowing, give your span[class~="sr-only"] selector an overflow property set to hidden and a white-space property set to nowrap.



Finally, you need to take these hidden elements out of the document flow. Give the span[class~="sr-only"] selector a position property set to absolute, a padding property set to 0, and a margin property set to -1px. This will ensure that not only are they no longer visible, but they are not even within the page view.




The :first-of-type pseudo-selector is used to target the first element that matches the selector. Create an h1 .flex span:first-of-type selector to target the first span element in your .flex container. Remember that your span elements are reversed, visually, so this will appear to be the second element on the page.



The :last-of-type pseudo-selector does the exact opposite - it targets the last element that matches the selector. Create an h1 .flex span:last-of-type selector to target the last span in your flex container, and give it a font-size property set to 1.2em to make it look like a header.



The calc() function is a CSS function that allows you to calculate a value based on other values. For example, you can use it to calculate the width of the viewport minus the margin of an element:

.example {
  margin: 10px;
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}




Before you start diving in to the table itself, your span elements are currently bolded. Create a span:not(.sr-only) selector and give it a font-weight property set to normal.

The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do not match the selector - in this case, any of your span elements that do not have the sr-only class. This ensures that your earlier rules for the span[class~="sr-only"] selector are not overwritten.-->
