<!-- HTML tables use the caption element to describe what the table is about. The caption element should always be the first child of a table, but can be positioned with the caption-side CSS property.
 


 The thead and tbody elements are used to indicate which portion of your table is the header, and which portion contains the primary data or content.


The tr element is used to indicate a table row. Add a tr element within your thead element. In your new tr element, add a td element, followed by three th elements.


The CSS you are about to write is a common set of properties used to ensure elements are completely hidden visually.

The span[class~="sr-only"] selector will select any span element whose class includes sr-only. Create that selector, and give it a border property set to 0.-->
